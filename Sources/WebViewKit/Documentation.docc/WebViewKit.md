# ``WebViewKit``

WebViewKit is a Swift SDK that adds a `WebView` to `SwiftUI`.



## Overview

![WebViewKit logo](Logo.png)

WebViewKit is a SwiftUI library that has a custom ``WebView`` that can be used in iOS 14, macOS 11 & visionOS 1.

The ``WebView`` component can be configured to fit your needs, while the iOS exclusive ``SafariWebView`` can be used for more basic needs and a more browser-like experience.

> Important: Since iOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26 all get a native `WebView` component, this library is only kept for polyfill purposes.



## Installation

WebViewKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:
